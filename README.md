# Interpretable_ML
Understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn and developing interpretable models to predict which customers are at risk of churning.  

### Steps:
* Assess assumptions for linear and logistic regression
* Run linear regression model, interpret results, and evaluate model
* Run logistic regression model, intepret results (as odd ratios) , and evaluate model
* Run Generalized Additive Model (GAM), interpret results, and evaluate model
* Evaluate and compare model performances and recommend best move forward in terms of predicting customer churn and actions to be taken
